		<p>Lee Van Arsdall currently resides in Jacksonville, Florida where he earned a BFA with a 
		concentration in photography from the University of North Florida. 
		He works as a Graphic Designer in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. 
		His current personal work deals with fabricating photographic images that question

		transcriptions of reality. He also enjoys working with alternative cameras and printing 
		methods to create works that push the boundaries of traditional photographic techniques.
